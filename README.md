# Little World - World Builder

This project aims to provide APIs to generate a world map for a game.

This map will be a 3D matrix generated by manipulating noise.

One day I aim to be able to generate [polygonal maps](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/)

But I'll start by following this tutorial: https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/
